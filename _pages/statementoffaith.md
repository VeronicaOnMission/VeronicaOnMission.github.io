## The Bible
I believe the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God. It is the final authority for faith, life, and godliness.

>**2 Timothy 3:16–17**\
*All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.*

## Salvation
I believe that salvation is a gift of God’s grace, received by faith in Jesus Christ alone. Through repentance and personal acceptance of Christ's finished work on the cross, we are born again and reconciled to God.

>**John 3:16**\
*For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.*

>**Romans 10:9–10**\
*That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.*

>**Ephesians 2:8–9**\
*For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.*<br>

## God
I believe in one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

>**Deuteronomy 6:4**\
*Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one!*

>**Matthew 28:19**\
*Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.*

>**2 Corinthians 13:14**\
*The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.*

## Jesus Christ
I believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, atoning death through His shed blood, bodily resurrection, ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His personal return in power and glory.

>**John 1:1–14**\
*In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.\ There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.\ He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\ And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.*

John 1:1-14
Luke 1:26–35<br>
Romans 8:34<br>
Acts 1:10–11<br>

## Holy Spirit
I believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, who indwells and empowers believers to live godly lives, equips them with spiritual gifts, and enables them for service and witness.

Acts 1:8<br>
Galatians 5:22–23<br>
1 Corinthians 12:4–11<br>

## The Return of Christ
I believe in the literal, visible return of Jesus Christ to establish His kingdom on earth.

1 Thessalonians 4:16–17<br>
Revelation 21

	<h4>The Bible</h4>
	<p>I believe the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God. It is the final authority for faith, life, and godliness (2 Timothy 3:16–17).</p>
	<h4>God</h4>
	<p>I believe in one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14).</p>
	<h4>Jesus Christ</h4>
	<p>I believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, atoning death through His shed blood, bodily resurrection, ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His personal return in power and glory (John 1:1–14; Luke 1:26–35; Romans 8:34; Acts 1:10–11).</p>
	<h4>Salvation</h4>
	<p>I believe that salvation is a gift of God’s grace, received by faith in Jesus Christ alone. Through repentance and personal acceptance of Christ's finished work on the cross, we are born again and reconciled to God (John 3:16; Romans 10:9–10; Ephesians 2:8–9).</p>
	<h4>Holy Spirit</h4>
	<p>I believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, who indwells and empowers believers to live godly lives, equips them with spiritual gifts, and enables them for service and witness (Acts 1:8; Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12:4–11).</p>
	<h4>The Return of Christ</h4>
	<p>I believe in the literal, visible return of Jesus Christ to establish His kingdom on earth (1 Thessalonians 4:16–17; Revelation 21).</p>

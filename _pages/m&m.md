## Scripture that inspires my work
> **1 Corinthians 9:16**\
"For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about, for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me if I don't preach the Good News."

> **Mark 16:15-18**\
“He said to them, ‘Go into all the world and preach the Good News to the whole creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned. These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages; they will take up servants; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”

> **Mark 4:26-27**\
And He said, “The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground. He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; he knows not how.

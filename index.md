  <font color="black"; style="text-shadow: white 0 -2px";><b>Hi there, and thank you for visiting!</b><br><br>  
  My heart is devoted to sharing the love of Jesus with the world. Whether it’s on the streets, in churches, or among the forgotten and hurting, I believe in meeting people with compassion and truth, through the power of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>  
  My mission is simple but urgent:<br>
  *I aim to carry the message of salvation to all people through evangelism, discipleship, and the demonstration of God’s love in action.*<br><br> 
  I invite you to explore my website, learn more about the work God is doing through this ministry, and join me in making an eternal impact.<font>
